## Introduction:
Welcome to **ChildJS🧒**, an open-source project aimed at introducing children to the world of programming through a simplified and playful JavaScript-like language called babyLanguage. ChildJS provides a fun and engaging platform for children to learn programming concepts in a friendly and intuitive way.

## Project Overview:
ChildJS is designed to be a beginner-friendly environment where children can explore programming concepts using simple syntax and familiar emojis. The project focuses on creating a learning playground that encourages creativity, experimentation, and problem-solving skills.

## Key Features:
**Features of ChildJS Playground:**
1. 💻 **Interactive Environment:**
   - Create an interactive playground environment for children to write and execute babyLanguage code in real-time.
   - Provide a user-friendly interface with syntax highlighting and error handling to enhance the coding experience.

2. 🎨 **Visual Editor:**
   - Incorporate a canvas-based whiteboard interface, allowing children to visualize their code execution dynamically.
   - Support hand-drawn-like style elements to make coding feel more creative and engaging.

3. 🌓 **Dark Mode:**
   - Implement a dark mode option to cater to different preferences and ensure accessibility in various lighting conditions.

4. 🏗️ **Customization:**
   - Allow customization of the playground interface, including themes, fonts, and editor settings, to suit individual preferences.

5. 📷 **Image Support:**
   - Integrate image support to enable children to upload and manipulate images within their projects, fostering creativity.

6. 😀 **Shape Libraries:**
   - Provide a library of pre-defined shapes and symbols for easy drag-and-drop usage, enhancing visual representation in projects.

7. 👅 **Localization (i18n):**
   - Support multiple languages to make the playground accessible to children from diverse linguistic backgrounds.

8. 🖼️ **Export Options:**
   - Enable export functionality to save projects as PNG, SVG, or clipboard-compatible formats, allowing children to share their creations easily.

9. 💾 **Open Format:**
   - Save projects in an open format `.childjs` to ensure compatibility across platforms and facilitate collaboration.

10. ⚒️ **Wide Range of Tools:**
    - Offer a variety of drawing tools such as rectangle, circle, arrow, line, free-draw, and eraser for creating diverse projects.

11. ➡️ **Arrow-Binding & Labeled Arrows:**
    - Implement arrow-binding and labeled arrows functionality to enhance visual communication and clarity in projects.

12. 🔙 **Undo / Redo:**
    - Provide undo and redo capabilities to allow children to experiment freely without fear of making mistakes.

13. 🔍 **Zoom and Panning:**
    - Support zoom and panning features to enable children to navigate and explore their projects easily, even on larger canvases.

<!-- **Requirements:**
- The playground should be accessible via web browsers without requiring any downloads or installations.
- Ensure compatibility with popular web browsers such as Chrome, Firefox, Safari, and Edge.
- Implement responsive design principles to ensure usability on various screen sizes, including desktops, tablets, and smartphones.
- Provide clear and concise documentation with tutorials, examples, and usage guidelines to assist children in using the playground effectively.
- Prioritize performance optimizations to maintain smooth and responsive interactions, even with complex projects.
- Foster a safe and inclusive community environment with moderation features to prevent misuse and promote positive interactions among users. -->


## Getting Started:

To start using ChildJS, follow these steps:

1. 🌐 Visit the ChildJS repository on GitHub: [Link to Repository](https://github.com/danishzayan/childJS.git)
2. 📥 Clone or download the repository to your local machine.
3. 📂 Open the project directory and explore the documentation to understand how to use the babyLanguage syntax and interact with the playground.
4. 🚀 Launch the interactive playground and start writing and executing babyLanguage code.

## Syntax and Usage:

ChildJS uses a simple and intuitive syntax inspired by JavaScript, with emojis representing programming concepts.

- 🍼 **Variables:** Declare variables using emojis e.g., `🍼 varName = value;`
- 💻 **Output:** Display messages using emojis e.g., `💻 display "Hello, World!";`
- 🔤 **Input:** Take input and assign it to variables using emojis e.g., `🔤 varName = input;`
- ➕➖✖️➗ **Arithmetic Operations:** Perform basic arithmetic operations using emojis e.g., `➕ varName = num1 + num2;`
- 🔍🔎 **Conditional Statements:** Use emojis for if-else statements e.g., `🔍 if condition then`
- 🔁 **Loops:** Create loops using emojis e.g., `🔁 loop numTimes times`

### Here's an example of highlighting syntax for ChildJS🧒:
```javascript
// Variables
🍼 varName = value;   // Declare a variable with value

// Output
💻 display "message";   // Display a message

// Input
🔤 varName = input;   // Take input and assign to variable

// Arithmetic Operations
➕ varName = num1 + num2;   // Addition
➖ varName = num1 - num2;   // Subtraction
✖️ varName = num1 * num2;   // Multiplication
➗ varName = num1 / num2;   // Division

// Conditional Statements
🔍 if condition then
      // code block
   🔚
🔎 else
      // code block
   🔚

// Loops
🔁 loop numTimes times
      // code block
   🔚

// Comments
📝 // This is a comment
